        </div>
        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p><a href="https://cloud.gov/">cloud.gov</a> is a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
          owned and operated by the U.S. General Services Administration’s Technology
          Transformation Service (TTS). It is intended to recover
          its costs from project teams and agencies that use it, so the ability to
          market its utility to potential government customers is paramount. </p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>When I joined the team in fall of 2015, the sum total of material
          available to market the product was 5,000 words of longhand Q&A for our
          outreach and communications teams. We also had the expertise of the person
          who created cloud.gov in the first place, but unless you could navigate a command
          line, you could not learn for yourself what cloud.gov was all about. We
          needed government CIOs, product engineers, and compliance
          teams to understand why a sales conversation was worth their time. The website
          (much as the product name suggests should exist) was a simple opportunity to
          make that clear.</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>I started by breaking the Q&A down into a categorized content inventory. I captured
          light metadata about each answer: Security, cloud infrastructure, price, etc: what
          did each answer actually address? I also captured the audiences for the information in
          any given question. The most content-dense categories told me what
          we wanted to say about the product, while the alignment of audiences against
          those categories helped me understand which audiences we were ready to talk to.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cgov-faq-inventory.png" alt="Part of a
              lightweight content inventory for cloud.gov that broke down talking points
              based on metadata like information category and audiences.">
              <figcaption>
                This content inventory included 13 information category columns, including
                some not captured here. The most frequent audience is <em>mgrs</em> (which
                was anyone in a management role over engineers); this affected our tone.
                The tech and usability categories had the most universal audiences, which
                made it was easy to identify that this information belonged together
                in a single content section.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>I rewrote the content in sections based on how audiences lined up with sets
          of question categories. This new IA enabled coherent reading about
          an unfamiliar product without jumping around. I forefronted the
          content aimed at audiences we were most prepared for (team managers
          rather than information security officers). And because the engineering knowledge
          of government CIOs and other managers is a mixed bag, and we didn’t yet have a good
          sense of what customers were going to ask for, I emphasized a collegial
          rather than technical tone throughout.</p>

        <p>Then we needed a homepage. To help federal IT decisionmakers see that cloud.gov
          existed for them, I focused on how that sense of collegiality led our team to
          create a product engineered for government’s cloud technology needs. </p>

        <p>To find the right overall tone, our team’s visual designer and I looked at the design
          choices of private sector cloud platform vendors. We tried to match the way they handled
          claims to credibility and ease of use, and we tried to contrast ourselves
          on claims of focus. We wanted to emphasize that cloud.gov was built by
          and for government employees, people who had worked within the government’s
          particular security compliance needs without
          sacrificing functionality or usability. We launched with a homepage that offered a high-level narrative
          of why the product exists and why government users should have confidence in it.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cg2-home2.png" alt="The second iteration of
              the cloud.gov homepage.">
              <figcaption>
                This is the second visual iteration still using most of
                the original content. The original content emphasized collegiality
                among government teams. This was how the site looked when I returned
                to the team a year later to incorporate what we learned from
                almost a year of selling cloud.gov services to other agencies into the
                site.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h4>The work, again</h4>

          <p>After taking on a different project for a few months, I rejoined the
            cloud.gov team in 2016. After almost a year of selling
            and supporting customers on the platform, we had a storehouse of knowledge about what
            wasn’t working. I read through inquiries to the support inbox and sat in on customer
            and sales conversations. I conducted highlighter testing with people involved
            in selling other services that used cloud.gov
            to understand what potential customers were struggling to understand.
            If the website could better support these efforts, cloud.gov and
            sales of related services could see improved conversion rates.</p>

          <p>My research showed that the original language was too abstract
            and focused on our rationale. It didn’t address customer goals. I revised the content to
            emphasize what customers were trying to achieve. I also forefronted the requirements
            for using cloud.gov, which reduced time lost to impossible leads.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cg2-home2-new.png" alt="The hero
              section of the cloud.gov homepage with more user-focused content.">
              <figcaption>
                This is a similar visual style, but the content emphasizes entirely different
                aspects of the cloud.gov experience. Instead of being about where
                the product came from, it‘s about what teams can do with the product.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cg2-yourworkfirst.png" alt="This cloud.gov homepage
              body copy focuses on what users need to do rather than on cloud.gov’s
              strengths in the abstract.">
              <figcaption>
                Previously, the language in this section focused on usability, scalability,
                security, and conformity with rules. It described cloud.gov as
                a piece of technology. The new language focused on how a customer’s
                experience of engineering products changes for the better as
                cloud.gov users. Hearing directly from people who had been through
                the sales process let us make a stronger and more specific case for
                the product on the users’ terms.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h4>The results</h4>

          <p>cloud.gov’s initial direction gave the entire team a common, coherent story about
            the product, one that aligned everyone with the platform’s creator.
            It was flawed, but it gave us a great baseline for usability
            research and iteration. As we learned more about our customers, the
            content evolved. We could speak to their circumstances directly. The
            revised content led potential customers to ask confident questions
            more specific to their apps and teams when they contacted us about the
            product.</p>
