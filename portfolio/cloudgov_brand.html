        <h2>Creating a brand for a government-owned cloud platform</h2>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <div class="container text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="img/cg2-cover.png" alt="One of the early design directions for cloud.gov." style="border: 1px solid #212529;">
        </div>
        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p><a href="https://cloud.gov/">cloud.gov</a> is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) owned and operated by the U.S.
          General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS).  </p>

        <p>cloud.gov’s funding mechanism means it is an experiment that needed to
          be cost recoverable, so the ability to market its advantages to other government agencies
          is paramount. </p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>When I joined the team in fall 2015, the sum total of material
          available to market the product was 5,000 words of long-hand Q&A and talking
          points for our outreach and communications teams. We also had the expertise of the person
          who instigated the development of cloud.gov in the first place, but unless you could navigate a command
          line, you could not learn for yourself what cloud.gov was all about. We needed government CIOs, product engineers, and compliance
          teams to understand why a sales conversation was worth their time.</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>5,000 words of longhand writing can’t give a product identity, but they
          can—and in this case did—provide the raw materials of one. I started by
          breaking the series of questions down
          into a categorized content inventory. I captured light metadata about each one: Did
          it address security, cloud infrastructure, price, or what?
          Who were the audiences for the information in any given question?</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cgov-faq-inventory.png" alt="Part of a
              lightweight content inventory for cloud.gov that broke down talking points
              based on metadata like information category and audiences.">
              <figcaption>
                This content inventory included 13 information category columns, including
                some not captured here. The
                the most frequent audience is <em>mgrs</em> (which was anyone in a management
                role over engineers), but the tech and usability categories
                offered the most universally targeted content. It was easy to identify
                that these things belonged together in a single content section.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>The most content-dense categories of information told me what
          we <em>wanted</em> to say about the product, while the alignment of audiences against
          those categories helped me understand who we were ready to talk to. With this,
          I broke the content into sections where question categories with similar audience alignment
          could be grouped together to enable coherent reading. I forefronted
          content aimed at audiences we were most prepared for (managers of engineering
          teams rather than information security officers). And because the technical knowledge
          of government technology managers is a mixed bag, I emphasized a collegial
          rather than technical tone.</p>

        <p>This was still not a sales pitch, however. Turning dense information into
          a homepage that would help CIOs see how it would benefit their teams to
          use cloud.gov meant telling the right story. Our team’s visual designer
          and I captured the content and visual choices of vendors in the space. We looked
          to be similar on claims of credibility and ease of use and different
          on claims of focus (in our case, built by and for the government’s particular
          security and compliance needs, without sacrificing functionality).</p>

        <p>The differentiation exercise let us explore two homepage directions: 1) a high-level short
          narrative of why the product exists and why people should be confident in it,
          and 2) a focus on specific advantages and features. We worked each one through
          the visual direction we were going and made a decision.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/cg2-home2.png" alt="The cloud.gov
              homepage, using the initial content.">
              <figcaption>
                The original cloud.gov homepage content emphasizes collegiality among
                government teams. The text demonstrates
                specific knowledge of the challenges of working in that environment (text
                later on the page rescues the reader from the possibly unsunny paragraph
                in the middle of this image). This is the second visual iteration still using
                the original content. This was how the site looked when I returned
                to the team a year later to incorporate what we learned from
                almost a year of selling cloud.gov services to other agencies into the
                site.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h4>The results</h4>

          <p>cloud.gov’s initial direction gave the entire team a common story about
            the product, one that aligned the sales, product, and engineerng teams with
            the goals of the platform’s creator. A year later, when I
            returned to the team to do additional work, the clarity of the initial
            direction made testing it for further improvement far easier
            than it otherwise might have been. It was decidedly flawed, but it
            facilitated strong usability research and iteration.</p>
