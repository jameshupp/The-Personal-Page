        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) launched its website,
          consumerfinance.gov, in 2011. At the time, the CFPB had about 50 employees.
          Over the next couple years, the agency grew to more than 1000 employees,
          but the design and engineering resources didn’t grow as quickly. Periodic
          site redesigns were small and served mostly to pay down technical debt
          and deliver on overdue promises to program offices. The result was a mishmashed
          tech stack, inconsistent visual style, and IA with little intentionality.</p>

        <p>In 2014, the Technology and Innovation team finally added enough capacity
          to devote a full-time multidisciplinary team to consumerfinance.gov. As
          the CFPB’s first content strategist, I joined the team, along with four
          engineers, two visual designers, two UX designers (one also serving as
          product manager), and a project manager.</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>For a website team, the CFPB presented a big stakeholder management problem.
          The CFPB was the first federal agency in which the prevailing attitude
          was the way you make something official is to put it online. So anyone
          responsible for any agency priority needed the website, and the desire
          to do it all quickly meant they needed it all the time. Because the agency
          itself was still establishing its own processes, everyone felt freedom
          and access to make requests.</p>

        <p>There were just as many external audiences we couldn’t ignore: regulated
          companies, consumer advocates, small-scale financial practitioners and
          coaches, consumers themselves, policymakers, state regulators, civil and
          criminal lawyers.</p>

        <p>The site had not met the needs of this huge number of stakeholders and
          audiences. It needed to do that while also being ready to adapt to future
          needs.</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>The project began with four priorities: well-organized content, an architecture
          that supports anticipated needs, unified visual design, and measurable
          onsite events. I devised a corresponding four-part approach to scope the
          content strategy work:

        <ol>
          <li>Create content and metadata according to the new information
        architecture.</li>

          <li>Use the challenges of using the content (for both administrators and
        users) to inform platform work.</li>

          <li>Shape content to align with the new design direction, and work through
        specific designs as we apply them to real content.</li>

          <li>Identify what we’re analyzing content for.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The universe of what we could have focused on was vast; these constraints
          kept the content work focused.</p>

        <h5>Foundational research</h5>

        <p>We began by building up a knowledge base for the team: internal stakeholder
          interviews; identifying owners for each content type; research into architecture
          and front-end framework choices; and exploring the existing digital and print
          visual styles.</p>

        <p>I lead a content audit. I recruited coworkers to assist me and coached
          them through capturing significant information. We noted missing and bad
          metadata, opportunities to add more, misused styles, out of date attachments
          and contact information, etc.</p>

        <h5>User research</h5>

        <p>I supported the UX team in conducting a series of user research efforts.
          First, we got external research recommendations from stakeholders to give
          us a sense of expert audiences. We learned that there was no simple way
          to use consumerfinance.gov. Sophisticated users had to know the whole
          site to find information they couldn’t work without. It was easier to
          email CFPB staffers, even for things that were online.</p>

        <p>We conducted further research with non-experts who had recently made
          significant financial decisions in their own lives. We used various methods
          over the course of our research and iteration:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Affinity diagrams and journey mapping to understand who shapes their
            financial decisions and how they make those decisions;</li>
          <li>Card sorts to learn how they think information labels relate to one
            another and how they would navigate among them;</li>
          <li>Dot voting to see how they feel about different vocabulary choices
            for labeling similar information; and</li>
          <li>Visual preference testing to hear reactions to different voices, tones,
            design directions, and media elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We learned that people took advice from sources they trusted for personal
          reasons, not for expertise reasons. The <em>.gov</em> in the CFPB’s domain
          wasn’t worth much; friendly, accessible design went a lot further.</p>

        <h5>Giving the site structure</h5>

        <p>The UX team introduced cross-site relationships based on metadata that
          I assigned to different content. It made related content embeddable, freeing
          some workflow challenges from sitemap limits while still letting users benefit
          from a more constrained browsing experience.</p>

        <p>The UX team developed a sitemap based on longitudinal user journeys rather
          than parallel task types. To make this work, navigation menus for each
          section also needed to be individually tailored. The visual designers
          created layouts for each, and I worked with them to further group content
          in ways that created a natural flow for the targeted audiences of each
          section. We kept the copy short and allowed space for expansion so the
          sections could work both as we designed it and in the future.</p>

        <p>Getting buy-in on section labels proved the trickiest stakeholder management
          problem: experts had concerns with almost every design choice, but we needed
          their buy-in because this governed the site as a whole. At the same time,
          they were pushing us to get something online to show progress for all the
          time we’d invested. I redirected this pressure in a way that created a
          stronger relationship with the stakeholders and earned the team more trust
          to do its work.</p>

        <p>I brought the senior management team together, explained the site team’s
          proposal, and asked them to comment freely. They argued with each other
          over language for nearly an hour. Eventually some of them suggested the
          impediment to progress was their lack of agreement, not our work process.</p>

        <p>Within a few weeks, we had buy-in to represent navigation on a beta version
          of the website with language we already had. In turn, we pledged to continue
          researching and refining, exactly in line with the way we had hoped to
          work in the first place. The senior managers gave universal praise to
          beta.consumerfinance.gov when it launched in 2015.</p>

        <h5>Workflow and governance</h5>

        <p>Migrating content to the new site required coordinating a number of pieces:
          drafting, shaping content to the visual design components, circulating
          for review, and publication. I set up an agreement with the executive
          secretary to help us circulate content effectively, first on paper and
          then as designed. I established a process and timeframes for the site
          team, so every office that worked with us to migrate knew exactly what
          to expect. I created copy decks based on the IA work, ran initial coaching
          sessions on the site’s goals and user-centered writing, and then trusted
          the program offices to write first drafts.</p>

        <p>As we began this work with program offices, we brought on an additional
          content strategist. I served as the team lead and coached her through
          managing relationships with program offices. We divided responsibility
          and, as much as possible, co-located with our respective partners while
          we worked with them to maintain open conversation. Offices owned the accuracy,
          goals, and priorities, and the site team owned copyediting and the choices
          for how to represent the content, in line with those initial four goals.</p>

        <h5>Results</h5>

        <p>Because of the agency’s caution about how it affected markets, the full
          launch of the new site didn’t come until 2017. But the style, voice, and
          architecture we established and iterated on using beta.consumerfinance.gov
          continue to inform consumerfinance.gov today.</p>

        <p>The voice we established for the CFPB lined up with the lighter, friendlier
          design style. We focused on being informative over being prescriptive. The
          hierarchy of information was flexible, depending on office priorities, but
          it consistently fit the new design elements.</p>

        <p>We developed metadata tools that supported publication in both the existing
          and new styles at the same time, making the process as seamless as possible
          for content managers. Users could benefit from more constrained activity
          because related content populated into sections that targeted their experience.</p>

        <p>We established working relationships with program offices, building up
          trust that had broken down between content producers and the content management
          operation that seemed to tell them “no” or “what about over here” as often
          as “yes.”</p>

        <p>All the new page and content types had knowable purposes. When we wanted
          to measure on-site events, it was easy to know what measures worked best
          for what content types because we understood what those types were trying
          to do for users.</p>
