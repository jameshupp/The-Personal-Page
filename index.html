	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>James Hupp is a person. He spends a lot of time in both Washington and Brooklyn. He leads content strategy at the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/"></a>U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>. At present, most of his work is wrapped up in a full refresh of the website. He and the rest of the team want you to <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh">use and share the code associated with the new designs</a>.</p>
	<p>James's career began in digital campaigning. Once upon a time, he <a href="http://www.mrss.com/">helped progressive non-profits use email to raise money and advocate for change</a>. In 2008, he joined Obama for America <a href="http://donate.barackobama.com/page/outreach/splash/main">to improve the campaign's grassroots fundraising tools and to empower campaign supporters to raise money on their own</a>. And in 2009, he joined a campaign colleague's <a href="http://revolutionmessaging.com/">new progressive digital strategy firm</a>, serving as Vice President during its startup phase.
	<p>In 2010, providence intervened in the form of a <a href="http://about.me/merici">former and soon-to-be colleague</a>'s recruiting pitch to join a new startup, this time in government. She asked James to help the CFPB tell its story to the public. He created the content for the new agency's even newer website. In time, he realized that the real challenge was managing the neverending churn of new information. Campaigning had taught him the skills and strategies to motivate an audience; government taught him that content had to be sustainable. For the last four years, he's developed strategies to create and manage useful, usable, and brand-compliant content over the long term.</p>
	<p>Originally from Kansas City, Missouri, James learned young that <a href-"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City-style_barbecue">barbecue is art.</a> He also learned that sports fans are doomed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hdWdvsQE9w">cruelty</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=baker/060417_royals">hopelessness</a>, and <a href="http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2014/1/6/5274710/kansas-city-chiefs-playoff-losses">pain</a>. That's probably at least part of why he went to Northwestern University. He's long loved trivia and promises to be your team's expert in sports and the history of pop music. He's developing a travel habit, abetted by his <a href="http://www.lauraolin.com/">delightful girlfriend</a>. He's also developing a pickling habit, abetted, sadly, by nobody. He's sort of a weirdo, but in a nice way. <a mailto="jrhupp@gmail.com">Get in touch!</a></p>
