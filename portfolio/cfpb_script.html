        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created in the wake
          of the financial crisis to to provide a single point of accountability
          for enforcing federal consumer financial laws and protecting consumers
          in the financial marketplace. In 2015, I was working on a team redesigning
          the agency’s website, consumerfinance.gov. As my team moved into redsigning
          the careers section of the site, we encountered an opportunity.</p>

        <p>One of the CFPB’s operating principles was a commitment to bringing the
          brightest minds it could find into government to pursue a meaningful
          mission. In a number of different areas, the agency encountered problems supporting
          this commitment. Recruiting technologists to move to the capital
          was difficult. The pace of work across the agency was grueling. And for some
          roles, the very companies we were regulating was willing to pay far
          more money to join them.</p>

        <p>The result was that hiring was a constant need.
          The agency couldn’t afford to have applications from good people rejected
          because they didn’t understand government hiring rules.</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>Government hiring rules are complex. Even within a single job within a single agency, there
          maybe several different sets of standards for how to qualify. This makes it
          hard to provide clear and accurate information to the public, who generally aren’t
          familiar with the basics let alone the
          specifics. But these hard-to-understand rules are strictly observed. Being rejected
          as unqualified from a job opportunity for which anyone can see you are,
          in fact, qualified is not uncommon.</p>

        <p>The CFPB’s mission was all about making the fine print understandable to
          ordinary consumers. As a matter of the organization’s ethos, it was unacceptable
          to decide the complexity of rules meant we couldn’t offer direct, useful advice.</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>I worked with the Director of Talent Acquisition to identify the few parts of the
          application process that stood in the way most often. Rather than trying to
          clear the entire set of hurdles, we focused on the ones that seem most opaque and
          cause the most mysterious frustration to job applicants. We settled on three core
          issues: the concept of “minimally qualified” the unpredictability of the hiring
          manager’s role in the process, and the right way to ask a direct question about
          your own application.</p>

        <p>The deeper we got into explaining the process, the clearer it became that we
          couldn’t write a set of style-compliant web content that could make the process
          transparent enough to work through. What we needed was to tell a story
          that let people have a lightbulb moment about their own experience, whether
          they had been rejected or were trying to figure it out for the first time.</p>

        <p>I wrote a script and worked with our visual designers to develop a tone,
          vocabulary, and visual language that served to demystify. We focused on
          approachability and giving applicants a clear understanding of <em>how</em> and
          <em>why</em> the process feels weird.</p>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>The fist thing the video accomplished was to set down a marker
          for the website we were redesigning. It was released more than a year before
          the redesign changeover from beta.consumerfinance.gov to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">consumerfinance.gov</a>
          and it established both the voice and visual direction we were giving the new site.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCbZnTIeTOY"
          frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
          picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

        <p>The impact on the CFPB’s hiring efforts of the video itself was never well ascertained. The
          growing number of modern digital programs in the federal government, however,
          have used this video to encourage assertive recruitment by their own agencies.
          Agencies often give into their own worries that innovative people don’t apply, and
          the most effective thing to do sometimes is to arm people who are trying to
          change their minds with tools like this.</p>
