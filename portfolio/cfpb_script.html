        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created in the wake
          of the financial crisis to to provide a single point of accountability
          for enforcing federal consumer financial laws and protecting consumers
          in the financial marketplace. In 2014, I was part of a new multidisciplinary
          design and development team redesigning
          the agency’s website, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov">consumerfinance.gov.</a></p>

        <p>We had done quite a bit of foundational research work. This let us develop quite
          a few early stage guardrails for iterative development. We had a rough idea of
          the sitemap and both the visual and content style. But as a financial regulator, the CFPB
          approached every type of publishing with an abundance of caution over how it might affect markets.
          So developing something production-ready, even in beta, was slow. We needed to show
          that our directions could be helpful somewhere that didn’t have this risk. As the team
          moved into redsigning the careers section of the site in 2015, we found an opportunity.</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>For a number of reasons, hiring at the new agency was a constant need.
          The agency couldn’t afford to see applications from good people rejected
          because they didn’t understand government hiring rules. From a regulatory
          perspective, however, talent acquisition was a far less fraught area to
          experiment with.</p>

        <p>Federal hiring is complicated. Even for a single job
          in a single agency, there maybe different sets of standards
          for how to qualify. This makes it hard to provide clear and accurate information
          to the public, who generally aren’t familiar with the basics let alone the
          specifics. It’s not uncommon to be rejected as unqualified for a job that anyone can see you are,
          in fact, qualified for.</p>

        <p>The CFPB’s work is all about making fine print understandable to
          ordinary consumers. As a matter of ethos, it was unacceptable to us to let
          the complexity of rules meant we couldn’t offer direct, useful advice.
          And as a practical matter, if we couldn’t offer good information about
          applying, hiring would always be a drag on the agency. How could we
          provide job applicants the clarity they needed?</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>Initially, we wanted to describe the entire application process with
          all its caveats. As I worked through the issues with the Director of Talent Acquisition,
          it was clear this would be too much for something that wasn’t
          core to the agency’s mission. Instead, we tried to explain the parts of
          the process that confused in the way most often: the concept of “minimally
          qualified,” how terminology mismatches with the job announcement could sink an
          application, and the right way to ask questions about your own application.</p>

        <p>To explain even these things longhand risked exploding other parts
          of the careers section: new job listings, special hiring programs, etc.
          All people needed were lightbulb moments about their own experience, not every
          detail. We also thought that this content could be useful to people in
          offices around the agency and across the government so we wanted something sharable.
          The most interesting solution seemed like a video.
          It could support the content around it, explore the more progressive
          (cartoony) parts of our visualstyle, and tell the necessary story, even if
          someone was applying at a federal agency other than the CFPB.</p>

        <p>I wrote a script and worked with our visual designers to storyboardthe video. We
          focused on demystification and approachability above all. We knew the process
          felt weird; we’d gone through it ourselves. We wanted applicants to understand <em>why</em>
          it felt weird.</p>

                <iframe class="mb-3" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCbZnTIeTOY"
                  frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
                  picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                  <div class="container text-center">&nbsp;</div>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>The fist thing the video accomplished was to set down a marker
          for our new designs. It was released more than a year before
          the changeover from beta.consumerfinance.gov to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">consumerfinance.gov</a>.
          It established that both the voice and visual direction we were trying could
          break through the complication of some material to help people connect
          with government information.</p>

        <p>The impact on the CFPB’s hiring efforts was never well ascertained. The
          growing number of modern digital programs in the federal government, however,
          have used this video to encourage assertive recruitment by their own agencies.
          Agencies often give into their own worries that innovative people don’t apply, and
          the most effective thing to do sometimes is to arm people who are trying to
          change their minds with tools like this.</p>

        <p><em>The video in this case study supports the CFPB’s
