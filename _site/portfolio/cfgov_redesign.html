        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created in the wake
          of the financial crisis to to provide a single point of accountability
          for enforcing federal consumer financial laws and protecting consumers
          in the financial marketplace.</p>

        <p>The CFPB launched its website, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov">consumerfinance.gov</a>,
          in 2011. At the time, the CFPB had about 50 employees and was growing rapidly,
          both in terms of personnel and in terms of policy and communication deliverables. There
          were few limits on who could make demands of the site, how often, and in what way.</p>

        <p>By 2014, the agency had more than 1000 employees. Adding digital technology
          talent had lagged others, and the site had become a significant stakeholder
          management problem. And there were just as many external audiences that the site couldn’t ignore: regulated
          companies, consumer advocates, small practitioners, financial
          coaches, other policymakers, journalists, civil and criminal lawyers, and
          consumers themselves of all sorts of backgrounds working on all sorts of problems.</p>

        <p>In 2014, the CFPB Office of Technology and Innovation finally added enough capacity
          to devote a full-time multidisciplinary team to consumerfinance.gov. As
          the CFPB’s first content strategist, I joined the team, along with four
          engineers, two visual designers, two UX designers (one also serving as
          product manager), and a project manager.</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>Periodic redesigns in the first few years had served mostly to pay down
          critical technical debt and deliver on overdue promises to program offices.
          The limited resources combined with emergent vital needs meant no lasting
          strategy for the site had been adhered to. The result was a mishmashed
          tech stack, inconsistent visual style, and IA with little intentionality.
          The site was out of date, but the bigger problem was the site was never ready
          to flex for future growth.</p>

        <p>The project began with four goals: well-organized content, an architecture
          that supports anticipated needs, unified visual design, and measurable
          onsite events.</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>To scope the project’s content work, I started with a four-part approach that
          corresponded to those goals:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Create content and metadata according to the new information
        architecture.</li>

          <li>Inform platform work through clarity about the challenges of both administering
        and consuming content.</li>

          <li>Shape content to align with the new design direction, and work through
        specific designs as we apply them to real content.</li>

          <li>Identify what purposes we’re analyzing content for.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The universe of what we could have focused on was vast; these constraints
          kept the content work focused.</p>

        <h5>Giving ourselves foundational knowledge</h5>

        <p>We began by building up a knowledge base for the team: internal stakeholder
          interviews; identifying owners for each content type; research into architecture
          and front-end framework choices; and exploring the existing digital and print
          visual styles.</p>

        <p>I lead a content audit, capturing 20 columns of information about hundreds of
          pages across the site. I recruited coworkers to assist me and coached
          them through when to capture everything and when to capture only deviations.
          We noted missing and bad metadata, opportunities to add more, misused styles,
          out of date attachments and information, etc.</p>

        <h5>Researching with users</h5>

        <p>I supported the UX team in conducting a series of user research efforts.
          First, we got external research recommendations from stakeholders to give
          us a sense of expert audiences. We learned that there was no simple way
          to use consumerfinance.gov. Sophisticated users had to know the whole
          site to find information they couldn’t work without. It was easier to
          email CFPB staffers, even for things that were online.</p>

        <p>We conducted further research with non-experts who had recently made
          significant financial decisions in their own lives. We used various methods
          over the course of our research and iteration:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Affinity diagrams and journey mapping to understand who shapes their
            financial decisions and how they make those decisions;</li>
          <li>Card sorts to learn how they think information labels relate to one
            another and how they would navigate among them;</li>
          <li>Dot voting to see how they feel about different vocabulary choices
            for labeling similar information; and</li>
          <li>Visual preference testing to hear reactions to different voices, tones,
            design directions, and media elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container text-center">
          <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cfpb-la-concepts.jpg" alt="A design testing
              subject reviews a concept for consumerfinance.gov">
            <figcaption>
              We asked test subjects to review existing designs for other providers of financial
              information, as well as concepts for the new consumerfinance.gov.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>We learned that people took advice from sources they trusted for personal
          reasons, not for expertise reasons. The <em>.gov</em> in the CFPB’s domain
          wasn’t worth much; friendly, accessible design went a lot further.</p>

        <h5>Giving the site structure</h5>

        <p>The UX team introduced cross-site relationships based on metadata that
          I assigned to different content. Serialized content became a single content
          type, recent updates, and I developed the metadata taxonomy—categories,
          topics, authors, etc.—for the log that enabled. I then worked with content owners
          to set rules for which metadata signaled that recent updates should
          be embedded in their persistent content.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cfgov-recentupdates.png" alt="The
              user interface for the recent updates content type on consumerfinance.gov.
              The filtering menu includes name, category, topic, author, and date range.">
              <figcaption>
                This user-facing UI to explore <em>Recent updates</em> includes most of
                the same metadata that the recent updates content type offers to
                administrators. The category, topic, and author information could also be used to embed
                links to this content in persistent page types. By focusing on good
                metadata, we continued to enable individual pages for each
                category, and to enable teams to share their updates on persistent pages.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>This went hand in hand with a UI based on longitudinal user journeys rather
          than parallel task types. It also required navigation menus tailored for each
          section. The visual designers created layouts, and I worked with them to organize
          menu options according to a natural flow for the targeted audiences. We kept the
          copy short and allowed space for expansion. In the present, there was more visual
          breathing room; in the future, the menus could continue to work without needing
          additional significant redesigns.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cfgov-megamenu.png" alt="An example of
              an expanded menu from consumerfinance.gov from March 2019 showing the multi-column
              menu style, a featured content section, and room to expand.">
              <figcaption>
                Each top navigation menu on consumerfinance.gov is tailored to its
                section. The overview link at the top and featured content on the
                right are not present in all menus. Other menus include subheadings and
                external links for specific purposes. Because the top nav content
                type is limited to a few items, it represents an ideal place for
                customized structures. There is space for expansion, and content
                is grouped logically. In this case, the CFPB’s research output,
                market data and trends, surveys, and researcher information.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <h5>Managing stakeholder input</h5>

        <p>Getting buy-in on section labels proved the trickiest stakeholder management
          problem. Senior managers from across the CFPB had concerns with almost
          every choice, but we needed their buy-in because this governed the site
          as a whole. At the same time, they were pushing us to deliver to production
          to show progress for all the time already invested.</p>

        <p>To turn this pressure into something productive for
          the team, I led a meeting for the senior managers in which I explained the site team’s
          navigation concept and then asked them to comment freely. They began to argue with each
          other rather than the site team over language, which demonstrated that
          the necessary condition for progress was agreement amonmg them more than a change
          in our work.</p>

        <p>Within a few weeks, we had buy-in to represent navigation on a beta version
          of the website with language we already had. In turn, we pledged to continue
          researching and refining, exactly in line with the way we had hoped to
          work in the first place. This established a sense of trust that delivering
          notional work and testing it was superior to defining all design deliverables
          in advance. When beta.consumerfinance.gov launched in 2015, it received
          near-universal praise across the agency.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/beta-cfgov-may2015-full.png" alt="A
              screenshot of beta.consumerfinance.gov as it appeared in May 2015.">
              <figcaption>
                beta.consumerfinance.gov was released in 2015 to show our work in
                progress. In addition to the site design direction, we made design
                choices for beta to allay fears about confusing the market the CFPB
                regulates. The hero uses design-oriented rather than finance-oriented
                imagery. The button in the hero links to an overview of the
                new direction and a request for feedback. The copy specifies the purpose
                of the work. The navigation menus, including the live About menu,
                would continue to change as we learned more about the audiences
                we were serving.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <h5>Defining content governance and workflow</h5>

        <p>Migrating content to the new site required coordinating a number of pieces:
          drafting, shaping content to the visual design components, circulating
          for review, and publication. I set up an agreement with the executive
          secretary to help us circulate content effectively, first on paper and
          then as designed. I established a process and timeframes for the site
          team, so every office that worked with us to migrate knew exactly what
          to expect. I created copy decks based on the IA work, ran initial coaching
          sessions on the site’s goals and user-centered writing, and then trusted
          the program offices to write first drafts.</p>

        <p>As we began this work with program offices, we brought on an additional
          content strategist. I served as the team lead and coached her through
          managing relationships with program offices. We divided responsibility
          and, as much as possible, co-located with our respective partners while
          we worked with them to maintain open conversation. Offices owned the accuracy,
          goals, and priorities, and the site team owned copyediting and the choices
          for how to represent the content, in line with those initial four goals.</p>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>Because of the agency’s caution about how it affected markets, the full
          launch of the new site didn’t come until 2017. But the style, voice, and
          architecture we established and iterated on using beta.consumerfinance.gov
          continue to inform consumerfinance.gov today.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">

                consumerfinance.gov as it looked in March 2019 (top) and January
                2015 (bottom). The new hero is persistent and focuses on establishing
                trust by introducing consumers to what the CFPB is, rather than
                leading with the newest tools. The navigation menus capture whole areas
                of interest instead of activity types.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>The voice we established for the CFPB lined up with the lighter, friendlier
          design style. We focused on being informative over being prescriptive. The
          hierarchy of information was flexible, depending on office priorities, but
          it consistently fit the new design elements.</p>

        <p>By treating all serialized content types as one type, we simplified content
          management in the long run. While we were migrating, the metadata tools supported publication
          simultaneously in the existing and new styles, making the process as seamless as possible
          for content managers. Creating metadata that enabled embeddable updates reined in users’
          confusion at browsing across the whole site. Clear menus made it easier to
          start in the right place.</p>

        <p>The team’s working relationships with program offices as we migrated
          rebuilt trust that had broken down between content producers and the content management
          team under the duress of the earlier, harried version of the site.</p>

        <p>All the new page and content types had knowable purposes. When we wanted
          to measure on-site events, it was easy to know what measures worked best
          for what content types because we understood what those types were trying
          to do for users.</p>
