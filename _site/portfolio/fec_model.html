        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC)
          administers and enforces federal campaign finance law. For every presidential
          or Congressional election, the FEC governs how campaigns raise, account
          for, and spend funds. In 2017 I joined a distributed team of designers
          and developers working with the FEC to redesign their website.</p>

        <p>When I joined the team,
          the focal points of the work were 1) completing migration to a beta version of
          the new site suffiently to make it the primary site; and 2) coaching the FEC’s
          content managers, designers, and engineers to manage the site effectively
          without us.</p>

        <p>Much of the content work that had already been done focused on developing
          plain language help for people who needed to understand the rules: eligibility,
          deadlines, definitions, etc. What had not been worked on was reporting
          guidance. Every candidate, party, and political action committee that
          engages in political activity for federal elections has reporting
          requirements. Since the FEC’s enforcement actions and data publication stem directly
          from what people report, getting this right was essential.</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>The FEC had plenty of material to support reporting: software to
          manage and automate filing, along with its user manual; complex scenarios
          designed to train multiple reporting needs at once at in-person conferences;
          full-scale campaign finance guides for each type of campaign committee;
          video walkthroughs of the software; and FAQs. For nearly every reporting
          task, there was some overlapping combination of examples and instruction
          available, each produced and managed by a different set of people.</p>

        <p>Research showed that repetitive and disparate reporting example content
          meant people were never certain they had the most up-to-date information,
          or complete information. Siloing the content types away from each other
          confused users. Teams at the FEC were repeating work they didn’t need
          to. And keeping them separate from the help content meant it was never
          available as-needed in the amount needed; veteran campaigners might know
          it, but it was effectively hidden from people new to the field."</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>I partnered with a senior FEC analyst to select relatively complex
          examples of reporting needs (for example, how to report a loan from a candidate
          to their own campaign and then how to report repayment of that same loan). These
          served as the basis for the just-in-time reporting instructions we
          hoped to develop.</p>

        <p>Our next task was to figure out how to contextualize reporting as an
          activity. Most reporting is quarterly, but it stems from actions taken
          every day. So first we established that every one of the reporting needs,
          both our chosen examples and others, corresponded to existing or in-progress
          help content. (For example, there was already content about whether
          and how a candidate could make a loan to their own campaign, and what
          the rules were for repaying that loan.) The opportunity was clear:
          when someone encountered an unfamiliar situation, that was a chance to explain
          both the rules and how to report their activity. Giving that context to
          reporting could make it more memorable.</p>

        <p>From there, I pulled the relevant information for each of our
          chosen examples from the existing reporting materials. I built single narratives
          for each example, shifting language to abide by our new style guide and to
          take advantage of the FEC glossary. We incorporated supporting media like
          images of standard forms and links to instructional video where appropriate.</p>

        <p>As I wrote the first sample, I outlined it in a basic content model.
          For each new sample, I adjusted the model. Since we’d chosen complex samples,
          we expected the ultimate model to cover most use cases cleanly.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/working-RE-model.png" alt="The content model for
              FEC reporting examples, as it looked in development, shows the hierarchy
              of the reporting content and its relationship to the help content.">
              <figcaption>
                The content model for reporting examples established a hierarchy
                for the information we were bringing together. The <em>main
                page</em> was existing help content, and then the <em>reporting
                examples</em> lived alongside them. The color key refers to sections
                of the samples I wrote; it helped the FEC analysts understand
                the origin of information I was reworking. This helped them make
                quick decisions about what needed legal or policy review and what
                would be ready to publish quickly.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>I then worked through approaches with our visual designer, adjusting
          language and hierarchy to make sure the structure could
          work with our principles and style. Once implemented, the result
          was a new content type in the CMS called <em>reporting examples</em>, presented
          individually on the website as <em>How to report: <strong>[need]</strong></em>.
          And because it was its own content type, we could drop cards linking
          to the reporting examples into any help content where they were relevant.
          The help content could lead people naturally into the reporting examples.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/RE-cards-help.png" alt="Reporting example
              cards, situated within help content, linked to the reporting example content
              assembled together.">
              <figcaption>
                When the new reporting examples went live, we were able to situate
                cards right in the middle of help content that hyperlinked to the
                reporting examples. In this case, both <em>Candidate personal funds
                loans</em> and <em>Loan principal and interest payments</em> were
                relevant to anyone who wanted to understand how candidates could
                use their personal funds to support their campaigns.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>The last test was to see whether the new reporting examples worked for
          the FEC’s content managers. I created a style guide for the components of
          the model. The analyst built a few, then she and I worked through the guide
          to make sure it addressed her questions so that the other content managers
          from her division could develop examples easily. Our visual designer worked
          through some of the same challenges with a graphic designer at the FEC.
          Following our work together, they published dozens in the new format in
          the space of a few weeks.</p>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>The reporting examples eliminated the partial overlaps of information,
          brought different aspects of the reporting process together out of
          their siloes, reduced duplication of work, and delivered the content
          to users right where they needed to understand it. Because the content managers
          from the FEC helped develop the process and the style guide, they
          were ready to implement it when we’d demonstrated that it works. Usability
          testing with campaign staffers demonstrated it was easy to follow and
          learn from.</p>

              <figcaption>
                Reporting examples began with introductions that provided any context
                someone might need, whether they were coming from the help content
                or not. Information about individual forms included both a visual
                example of the form that highlighted relevant fields, and
                a caption that explained what the candidate’s entries signified.
