        <p>The <a href="https://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC)
          administers and enforces federal campaign finance law. For every presidential
          or Congressional election, the FEC governs how campaigns raise, account
          for, and spend funds.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>In 2017 I joined a distributed team of designers and developers who
          were working with the FEC to redesign their website. When I joined,
          the focal points of the work were 1) switching the beta version of
          the new site to being the primary site; and 2) coaching the FEC’s
          content managers, designers, and engineers to manage the site effectively
          without us.</p>

        <p>Much of the content work that had already been done focused on developing
          plain language content to help people understand the rules: eligibility,
          deadlines, definitions, etc. What had not been worked on was reporting
          guidance. Every candidate, party, and political action committee that
          engages in political activity for federal elections has reporting
          requirements. How do you report to the FEC properly to demonstrate that you
          are following the rules?</p>

        <h4>The problem</h4>

        <p>The FEC had plenty of material to support reporting: software to
          manage and automate filing, along with its user manual; complex scenarios
          designed to train multiple reporting needs at once at in-person conferences;
          full-scale campaign finance guides for each type of campaign committee;
          video walkthroughs of the software; and FAQs. For nearly every reporting
          task, there was some overlapping combination of examples and instruction
          available, each produced and managed by a different set of people.</p>

        <p>Research showed that repetitive and disparate reporting example content
          meant people were never certain they had the most up-to-date information,
          or complete information. Siloing the content types away from each other
          confused users. Teams at the FEC were repeating work they didn’t need
          to. And keeping them separate from the help content meant it was never
          available as-needed in the amount needed; veteran campaigners might know
          it, but it was effectively hidden from people new to the field."</p>

        <h4>The work</h4>

        <p>I partnered with a senior FEC analyst to select some relatively complex
          examples of reporting needs (like how to report a loan from a candidate
          to their own campaign and then the repayment of that same loan). These
          served as the basis for the just-in-time reporting instructions we
          hoped to develop.</p>

        <p>Our first task was to figure out how to contextualize reporting.
          We went through the help content together and discovered that every
          one of the reporting needs corresponded to existing or in-progress
          help content. (For example, there was already content about whether
          and how a candidate could make a loan to their own campaign, and what
          the rules were around repaying that loan.) The opportunity was clear:
          when someone wanted to understand the rules, that was a chance to tell
          them how to report their activity. They might or might not need to know
          right then, but they would probably notice it was there.</p>

        <p>From there, I pulled out the relevant information for each of our
          chosen examples from the reporting materials. I built single narratives
          for each example, adding supporting media where appropriate. Bringing
          it together immediately let us eliminate duplicate information.</p>

        <p>Once we had the examples written out, I extrapolated them into a rough
          content model that could cover most use cases cleanly. Too much fidelity
          would have been counter to our usual approach: collaborate, learn by buildling,
          and iterating until we find something that works.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/working-RE-model.png" alt="The content model for
              FEC reporting examples, as it looked in development, shows the hierarchy
              of the reporting content and its relationship to the help content.">
              <figcaption>
                The content model for reporting examples established a hierarchy
                for the disparate information we were bringing together. The <em>main
                page</em> was the existing help content, and then the <em>reporting
                examples</em> lived alongside them. The color key, which I used to highlight
                the samples I built the model from, helped the FEC analysts understand
                the origin of information I was reworking.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>I then worked through approaches with our visual designer, adjusting
          language and hierarchy to make sure both content and design could
          work within our principles and style. Once implemented, the result
          was a new content type in the CMS called <em>reporting examples</em>, presented
          individually on the website as <em>How to report: <strong>[need]</strong></em>.
          And because it was its own content type, we could drop cards linking
          to the reporting examples into any help content where they were relevant.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/RE-cards-help.png" alt="Reporting example
              cards, situated within help content, linked to the reporting example content
              assembled together.">
              <figcaption>
                When the new reporting examples went live, we were able to situate
                cards right in the middle of help content that hyperlinked to the
                reporting examples. In this case, both <em>Candidate personal funds
                loans</em> and <em>Loan principal and interest payments</em> were
                relevant to anyone who wanted to understand how candidates could
                use their personal funds to support their campaigns.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>The reporting examples eliminated the partial overlaps of information,
          brought different aspects of the reporting process together out of
          their siloes, reduced duplication of work, and delivered the content
          to users right where they needed to understand it.</p>

          <div class="container text-center">
            <figure>
              <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="img/RE-realized.png" alt="A test image">
              <figcaption>
                Reporting examples began with introductions that provided any context
                someone might need, whether they were coming from the help content
                or not. Information about individual forms included both a visual
                example of the form that highlighted relevant fields, and
                a caption that explained what the candidate’s entries signified.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

        <p>The final step was making this new approach viable for the content
          managers, who were largely analysts and communications professionals.
          I created a style guide for the components of the reporting example,
          which they were able to use to assemble dozens of reporting examples
          in the space of a few weeks.</p>

        <p><em>The reporting example used most consistenly in this case study is
          <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/candidate-personal-funds-loans/">Candidate personal funds loans</a>.</em></p>
